Polynomial Regression - Regression is the concept which we used for predicting the values with best accuracy, in this datasets which we have provided we need to predict the values, we used Linear Regression since outcome of linear regression gives under fitting and gives very low frequency hence we use polynomial regression where it gives desired accuracy in train and test data
